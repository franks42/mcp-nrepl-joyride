# Lessons Learned: MCP-nREPL Joyride Implementation

Key insights and best practices from building a Babashka-based MCP server for Joyride integration.

## üéØ Strategic Decisions

### 1. Technology Stack Choice: Pure Babashka ‚úÖ
**Decision**: Implement everything in Babashka, rejecting TypeScript entirely
**Rationale**: User explicitly stated "no typescript... period"
**Outcome**: Excellent choice - fast startup, low memory, simple deployment

**Lessons**:
- Always respect user's technology constraints completely
- Babashka is excellent for this type of integration work
- Fast startup (~200ms) is crucial for MCP servers
- Single runtime simplifies deployment and debugging

### 2. Custom nREPL Client Implementation ‚úÖ
**Decision**: Build custom nREPL client instead of using standard libraries
**Problem**: Standard nREPL clients require JVM classes unavailable in Babashka
**Solution**: Socket-based implementation using raw TCP communication

**Key Insights**:
```clojure
;; Simple socket-based approach works better than complex libraries
(defn connect [host port]
  (let [socket (Socket. host port)
        out (PrintWriter. (.getOutputStream socket) true)
        in (BufferedReader. (InputStreamReader. (.getInputStream socket)))]
    {:socket socket :out out :in in :host host :port port}))
```

**Best Practices**:
- Test library compatibility early in Babashka environment
- Custom implementations can be simpler and more reliable
- Raw sockets provide full control over protocol communication
- Error handling is easier with direct socket management

## üîß Technical Challenges Overcome

### 1. Stateful vs Stateless Impedance Mismatch
**Challenge**: nREPL is stateful (sessions), MCP is stateless (tool calls)
**Solution**: Automatic session management with smart defaults

**Implementation Strategy**:
```clojure
;; Maintain session state across MCP calls
(def server-state (atom {:connections {} :sessions {} :default-session nil}))

;; Auto-create sessions when needed
(when-not (get-in @server-state [:sessions session-id])
  (create-session! session-id))
```

**Lessons**:
- Bridge stateful and stateless systems with careful state management
- Provide sensible defaults for session handling
- Allow explicit session control when needed
- Clean up resources automatically

### 2. Library Dependency Issues
**Problem**: `java.security.cert.Certificate` not available in Babashka
**Root Cause**: Standard nREPL libraries assume full JVM environment
**Solution**: Implement minimal protocol subset needed

**Key Learning**:
- Babashka's JVM compatibility is not 100%
- Security-related classes often missing in GraalVM native images
- Protocol implementations can be much simpler than full libraries
- Test dependencies in target environment early

### 3. Process Communication and Classpath Management
**Challenge**: MCP server run as subprocess couldn't find modules
**Error**: `Could not locate mcp_nrepl_proxy/nrepl_client__init.class`
**Solution**: Always include `-cp src` in subprocess calls

**Best Practice**:
```bash
# Wrong - classpath not specified
bb src/mcp_nrepl_proxy/core.clj

# Right - explicit classpath
bb -cp src src/mcp_nrepl_proxy/core.clj
```

**Insights**:
- Babashka's classpath behavior differs from Clojure JVM
- Always be explicit about classpath in production scripts
- Test subprocess execution scenarios thoroughly
- Document classpath requirements clearly

## üß™ Testing Strategy Insights

### 1. Mock Server Approach: Highly Effective ‚úÖ
**Strategy**: Build realistic mock servers for comprehensive testing
**Implementation**: 
- Simple test server for basic nREPL testing
- Enhanced Joyride mock server for VS Code API simulation

**Key Benefits**:
- No dependency on VS Code/Joyride for development
- Fast test execution (5-8 seconds vs minutes with real VS Code)
- Reproducible test conditions
- Comprehensive error scenario testing

**Mock Server Design Principles**:
```clojure
;; Realistic state management
(def server-state 
  (atom {:sessions {}
         :workspace {:files [...] :current-file "..."}
         :vscode {:active-editor {...} :notifications []}}))

;; Pattern-based response simulation
(cond
  (str/includes? code "joyride.core/execute-command")
  (execute-vscode-command (extract-command code))
  
  (str/includes? code "joyride/workspace-root") 
  (get-workspace-root))
```

### 2. Integration Test Architecture
**Approach**: Full end-to-end testing with process isolation
**Pattern**: Start server ‚Üí Test functionality ‚Üí Clean shutdown

**Critical Elements**:
- Proper process lifecycle management
- Resource cleanup in finally blocks
- Timeout handling for server startup
- Port file auto-discovery testing

### 3. Test Coverage Strategy
**Philosophy**: Test real usage patterns, not just code coverage
**Implementation**:
- Basic nREPL operations (eval, clone, describe)
- VS Code API integration patterns
- Calva middleware operations
- Session management and isolation
- Error handling scenarios

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Patterns

### 1. JSON-RPC 2.0 Implementation
**Pattern**: Clean separation of protocol handling and business logic
```clojure
(defn handle-request [request]
  (case (:method request)
    "initialize" (handle-initialize request)
    "tools/list" (handle-tools-list request)
    "tools/call" (handle-tool-call request)
    (error-response request "Method not found")))
```

**Best Practices**:
- Validate JSON-RPC structure early
- Provide detailed error responses
- Use consistent response formats
- Handle malformed requests gracefully

### 2. Resource Management Pattern
**Critical Pattern**: Always clean up resources
```clojure
(try
  ;; Main operation
  (catch Exception e
    ;; Error handling
  (finally
    ;; Cleanup - always runs
    (.close socket)
    (fs/delete-if-exists ".nrepl-port")))
```

**Key Insights**:
- Use try/finally for guaranteed cleanup
- Clean up in reverse order of creation
- Test cleanup paths explicitly
- Document cleanup responsibilities

### 3. Auto-Discovery Implementation
**Pattern**: Robust file-based service discovery
```clojure
(defn wait-for-port-file [timeout-ms]
  (let [end-time (+ (System/currentTimeMillis) timeout-ms)]
    (loop []
      (if (fs/exists? ".nrepl-port")
        (parse-port-file)
        (if (< (System/currentTimeMillis) end-time)
          (do (Thread/sleep 100) (recur))
          nil)))))
```

**Benefits**:
- Zero-configuration connection discovery
- Standard nREPL ecosystem pattern
- Robust timeout handling
- Works across different environments

## üìä Performance Insights

### 1. Babashka Performance Characteristics
**Startup Time**: ~200ms (vs 2-3 seconds for JVM Clojure)
**Memory Usage**: ~15-20MB (vs 100-200MB for JVM)
**Evaluation Speed**: ~50ms per operation

**Trade-offs**:
- Slower runtime execution than JVM
- Limited library ecosystem
- Excellent for short-lived processes
- Perfect for CLI tools and servers

### 2. Connection Management
**Pattern**: Lazy connection establishment with auto-discovery
**Benefits**:
- No unnecessary connections
- Graceful handling of unavailable servers
- Clean error reporting

### 3. JSON Processing
**Library Choice**: Cheshire for JSON handling
**Performance**: Adequate for MCP protocol needs
**Alternative Considered**: Built-in JSON (too limited)

## üé≠ User Experience Insights

### 1. Clear Error Messages
**Philosophy**: Errors should guide users to solutions
**Implementation**:
```clojure
(log :error "üí• nREPL connection failed")
(log :info "üìã Check if Joyride nREPL server is running")
(log :info "üîç Looking for .nrepl-port file in" (System/getProperty "user.dir"))
```

### 2. Development Experience
**Key Elements**:
- Clear startup messages with status indicators
- Debug mode with verbose logging
- Easy test execution commands
- Comprehensive documentation

### 3. Integration Simplicity
**Goal**: Minimal configuration for users
**Achievement**: Auto-discovery eliminates manual configuration
**Benefit**: Works out-of-the-box with standard Joyride setup

## üöÄ Scalability Considerations

### 1. Session Management
**Current**: In-memory session tracking
**Limitation**: Not persistent across server restarts
**Future**: Could add session persistence if needed

### 2. Connection Pooling
**Current**: New connection per MCP tool call
**Trade-off**: Simplicity vs efficiency
**Acceptable**: For human-driven interactions via Claude Code

### 3. Resource Limits
**Monitoring**: Track open connections and sessions
**Cleanup**: Automatic resource cleanup on errors
**Future**: Could add connection limits if needed
