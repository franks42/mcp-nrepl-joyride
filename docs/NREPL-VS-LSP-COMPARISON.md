# nREPL vs LSP vs MCP-nREPL Comparison

## 🎯 Core Philosophy Differences

### LSP (Language Server Protocol)
- **Static analysis** - Works without running code
- **Editor integration** - Designed for IDE features  
- **Project-wide** - Analyzes entire codebase
- **Language agnostic** - Same protocol for all languages
- **File-based** - Operates on source files

### nREPL (Network REPL)
- **Runtime interaction** - Works with live, running code
- **Dynamic evaluation** - Execute and inspect
- **Session-based** - Stateful interactions
- **Clojure-specific** - Tailored for Lisp workflow
- **Memory-based** - Operates on loaded code

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- **Tool gateway** - Provides access to external capabilities
- **AI-oriented** - Designed for LLM tool use
- **Protocol wrapper** - Can wrap other protocols
- **Service agnostic** - Can expose any service

### Typical Clojure Development Setup
- **Editors**: VS Code + Calva, Emacs + CIDER, IntelliJ + Cursive
- **Static features**: Provided by clojure-lsp
- **Dynamic features**: Provided by nREPL
- **Both protocols**: Run simultaneously, complementing each other

## 🤔 Use Case Comparison

### When to Use LSP
- Navigate unfamiliar codebases
- Refactor code safely
- Find all usages of a function
- Static code analysis
- Code formatting across project

### When to Use nREPL
- Interactive development
- Test hypotheses quickly
- Debug with real data
- Inspect runtime state
- Build up solutions incrementally

### When to Use MCP-nREPL
- Automation and scripting
- CI/CD integration
- Non-IDE tool access
- Cross-language integration
- AI/LLM tool use

## 💡 Key Insights

### Different Problems, Different Solutions
- **LSP asks**: "What does this code mean?" (static)
- **nREPL asks**: "What does this code do?" (runtime)
- **MCP asks**: "How do I access these capabilities?" (protocol)

### They're Not Competitors
- LSP handles what nREPL can't (static analysis)
- nREPL handles what LSP can't (runtime interaction)
- MCP makes both accessible to new consumers (AI, automation)

## 🎯 MCP-nREPL Enhancement Strategy

### Current State
- Basic eval, status, test operations
- Session support (basic)
- Auto-discovery of nREPL port

### Recommended Additions for Full nREPL Proxy

#### High Priority (Core nREPL features)
1. **load-file** - Load source files
2. **interrupt** - Stop runaway evaluations
3. **doc** - Get documentation
4. **source** - View function source
5. **complete** - Code completion
6. **list-sessions** - Manage sessions
7. **stacktrace** - Get error details

#### Medium Priority (Development features)
8. **ns-list** - List namespaces
9. **var-list** - List vars in namespace
10. **inspect** - Deep data inspection
11. **format** - Code formatting
12. **test-runner** - Run tests

#### Low Priority (Nice to have)
13. **history** - Command history
14. **dependencies** - Add dependencies dynamically
15. **refresh** - Reload changed namespaces

### What MCP-nREPL Should NOT Do
- Project-wide refactoring (LSP's domain)
- Static analysis (LSP's domain)
- File system navigation (better tools exist)
- Git operations (better tools exist)

## 🚀 Vision for MCP-nREPL

### Goal
Make MCP-nREPL the best possible nREPL proxy that exposes the full power of nREPL through the MCP protocol, enabling:

1. **Full REPL access** for automation tools
2. **AI/LLM integration** with Clojure development
3. **Cross-language** Clojure interaction
4. **Non-IDE tooling** for Clojure development

### Success Metrics
- Can perform all common nREPL operations
- Maintains session state properly
- Handles errors gracefully
- Provides clear, actionable responses
- Works reliably in automation

### Not Goals
- Replace IDE functionality
- Compete with LSP for static analysis
- Provide UI/visualization features
- Manage project dependencies

## 📝 Conclusion

MCP-nREPL should focus on being an excellent nREPL proxy, exposing the full dynamic power of nREPL through MCP. This complements LSP's static analysis capabilities rather than competing with them. Together, they provide comprehensive Clojure development support for both human developers and AI assistants.
